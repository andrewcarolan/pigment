# Pigment: a syntax highlighting utility

Takes an input file, applies syntax highlighting, and writes it into an HTML file so you can copy-paste the content elsewhere.

It uses Prism for formatting and supports JavaScript, TypeScript, and HTML.

## Installation

Install this module globally using the git URL for the repo:

```
npm i -g <git URL>
```

## Usage

```
pigment <input file>
```

Pigment writes the syntax-highlighted code to an HTML file and opens it your browser.
